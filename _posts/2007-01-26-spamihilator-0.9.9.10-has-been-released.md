Due to problems with Spamihilator 0.9.9.9 a new bugfix version has been released.
It contains the following fixes:

* The automatic update feature has been removed. This reduces the pressure
  onto the Spamihilator server, so it can be enabled in a few days.
* A bug has been fixed that caused screen savers not to start anymore.

The new version can be downloaded at the [Download page]({{ site.url }}/en/download).
