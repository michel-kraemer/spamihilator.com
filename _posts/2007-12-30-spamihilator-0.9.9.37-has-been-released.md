The new Spamihilator version 0.9.9.37 has just been released. This version
introduces a completely rewritten IMAP module which works now very flawlessly
(evaluated during comprehensive beta tests). Furthermore, some bugs have been fixed.

This is the complete list of changes:

* Completely rewritten IMAP module which supports all IMAP features now
* Added automatic update feature again
* Fixed bug: it is now guaranteed that messages will be rendered to your
  email client without any changes
* Fixed a bug in the Recycle Bin: adding a sender to the list of friends
  and respectively restoring all messages from this sender would not cause
  them to be downloaded if they had not been downloaded before
* Improved installer under Windows Vista
