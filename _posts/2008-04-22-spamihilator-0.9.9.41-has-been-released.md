The new Spamihilator version 0.9.9.41 has just been released. The prior
version had a bug which could lead to reduced filter quality. The so-called
DCC Filter did not work correctly on some systems. This bug has been resolved
now. So, installing the new version is recommended for all users.

Furthermore, the user interface under Windows Vista has been improved slightly.

Please download Spamihilator from the following website:
