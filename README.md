Building
--------

This website has been created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). If
you want to build it please follow these steps:

1. Download and install **Ruby 1.8.7** (if you haven't done so already).
   
   Under *Windows* I recommend to use [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/).
   Under *Linux* and *Mac OS* I highly recommend to use [rvm](https://rvm.io/)
   as the repository already contains proper `.ruby-version` and
   `.ruby-gemset` files.

2. Install the **bundler** gem (if you haven't done so already).

   `gem install bundler`

3. Clone or download this repository.

4. Open a command line shell in the cloned directory and enter the
   following command:

   `bundle install`

5. After that you are ready to build the website using the following
   commands:

   `compass compile`  
   `jekyll`

6. Repeat these commands whenever you make a change. The files will be
   compiled to the subdirectory `_site`.

Run locally
-----------

You may also run and test the website locally before uploading your
changes. In order to do this, follow the instructions above and then
run the following command:

    jekyll --server

Launch a web browser and open `http://localhost:4000` to view the site.
For more information see [Jekyll's website](http://jekyllrb.com).

Building and running with Docker
--------------------------------

If you don't have Ruby and don't want to install it you can use the Docker image:

    docker build -t spamihilator.com-dev .
    docker run -it -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd)/_site:/spamihilator.com/_site spamihilator.com-dev "jekyll --server"
