#### Spam and Non-Spam

All recognized spam mails will be saved to the Spamihilator Recycle Bin. They will
not be rendered to your mail client. So, a best possible separation between Spam and Non-Spam
can be achieved! Of course, you can restore messages from the Recycle Bin.

Use the Training Area to teach Spamihilator. It will learn which mails are Spam and
which are not. It will become better and better!
