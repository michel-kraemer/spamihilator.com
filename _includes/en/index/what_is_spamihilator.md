#### What is Spamihilator?

Spamihilator works between your email client and the Internet and examines every
incoming message. Useless spam mails (junk) will be filtered out. This process runs
completely in the background.

The Learning Filter (Bayesian Filter) uses the rules of Thomas Bayes (English mathematician,
18th century) and calculates a certain spam probability for every email. You can train this
filter! So it will know your messages even better than you. Hence the recognition
rate will continuously increase.

In addition, Spamihilator uses a Word-Filter that searches messages for known keywords.
User-defined words and regular expression can be added.

Of course, Spamihilator supports <a href="{{ site.url }}/en/plugins">plugins</a>.
These useful additional filters protect your system against annoying spam mails.

The program works with almost every email client, such as Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird,
Eudora, IncrediMail, Pegasus Mail, Phoenix Mail, Opera, etc.
