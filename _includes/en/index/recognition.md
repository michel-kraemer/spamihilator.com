#### Spam Recognition

Spamihilator uses a number of different filters in order to achieve the
highest spam recognition rate possible. The Learning Filter (Bayesian Filter)
uses the rules of Thomas Bayes (English mathematician, 18th century) and
calculates a certain spam probability for every email. Therefore the
Learning Filter already recognizes more than 98% of spam mails.
You can even train this filter! So it will know your messages even better than
you.

Additionally, Spamihilator contains the Spam Word Filter that searches
messages for known keywords. User-defined words and regular expression can be added.
Besides, Spamihilator contains the Link Filter, the DCC Filter and the Rule Filter. All
of them can be configured to your personal needs.

Use the Training Area to further improve Spamihilator's spam recognition rate or
install <a href="{{ site.url }}/en/plugins">plugins</a> that add more filters
or other useful features to the program.

The program works with almost every email client, such as Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird,
Eudora, IncrediMail, Pegasus Mail, Phoenix Mail, Opera, etc.
