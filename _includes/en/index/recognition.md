#### Spam Recognition

Spamihilator uses a number of different filters in order to achieve the
highest spam recognition rate possible. For example, the learning filter
already recognizes more than 98% of spam mails. Additionally, Spamihilator contains
the Spam Word Filter, the Link Filter, the DCC Filter and the Rule Filter. All
of them can be configured to your personal needs.

Use the Training Area to further improve Spamihilator's spam recognition rate or
install <a href="{{ site.url }}/en/plugins">plugins</a> that add more filters
or other useful features to the program.
