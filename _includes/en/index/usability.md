Spamihilator runs with all mail clients that support POP3 or IMAP.
Of course, there is a Setup-Wizard, which automatically configures your mail client.

Spamihilator is available in <a href="{{ site.url }}/en/download/language-packs">several languages</a>
and has got a comprehensive <a href="{{ site.url }}/help">Online Help</a>.
Furthermore the program lets you know when there is a new version available.
