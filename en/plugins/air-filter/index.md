### AIR Filter 0.1.5

_by Andrea Fontana_

This plugin is used to stop mails sended to Almost Identical Recipients (=AIR).
It's very quick (it works only on mail's headers) and it has a very low false positive rate (it never stops non-spam mails so far) so you can put it on top of plugins' priority list.

Last Changes:

* Minor issue corrected
* Few optimizations
