### Filter Statistics v1.1.4

_by Bob Loeffler_

The Filter Statistics is a plugin that allows the configuration and graphing of filter statistics.  Data is read from the spamihilator.ini and filter.log files (which are created by Spamihilator) and statistics are then computed by this plugin.

Includes full functionality and graphs (pie and bar charts)! Please see the included Help file and filterstats_ChangeLog.txt file for more details. A German Help file is also included.
