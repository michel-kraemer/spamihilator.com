### IMP-Filter

_by Dr. Detlef Meyer-Eltz_

The IMP-filter can classify e-mails as (non-)spam, which obstinately resist to other filters. To use the IMP-filter you have to create your individual mail parser by means of the TextTransformer program. You get the plugin and a detailed description from the following link:
