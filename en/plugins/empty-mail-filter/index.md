### Empty Mail Filter v1.3.2

_by Bob Loeffler_

This filter blocks e-mails that are empty or contain very few words. If the number of words that are found in the e-mail is less than or equal to the number you specify, the e-mail is considered spam.

You can specify whether file attachments (and/or inline attachments) will be used in the decision making of what is spam and what is not spam. For example, if a mail doesn't have any words, but it has a file attachment, you can say that the mail is empty (or not).

Version 1.1.2 allows you to ignore HTML tags in mails so they don't count as words.
