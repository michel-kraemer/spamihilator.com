### Whitestring-Filter v 1.5.0

_by Sebastian Laiblin_

Looks for special substrings (defined by you) in incoming mails, if the filter finds one of them the Mail is defined as "Non-Spam". Strings usable for this could be parts of your email signature, so that answers to your mails wonÂ´t ever sorted out by other filters (if the Whitestring-Filter is the first in your plugin-list, as recommended). Can also be used to accept all mails from newsletters and mailingslists; the it can perfectly substitute the Newsletter-Plugin that ships with Spamihilators mainversion.
