### Export Senders Plugin v1.2.2

_by Bob Loeffler_

This plugin utility allows you to export the e-mail addresses of Friends or Blocked Senders (or both) to a text file.  You can then import them into another installation of Spamihilator or even some e-mail clients. The data can be written to the text file in comma- or tab- or semicolon-delimited format, so the text file can be read in Excel and other spreadsheet software.
