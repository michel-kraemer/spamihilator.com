### Signature Filter 0.5.2

_by Bernhard MÃ¤hr_

This filter forces all mails to pass other filters if a part of our signature is included. This happens normally if someone replies on your mail.
Finds also Spam sent to you with your own EMail-adress as Sender.

The functionality of the second checkbox is not implemented yet.
