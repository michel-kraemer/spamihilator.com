### Mystic-Signs-Filter 1.1.1

_by Sebastian Laiblin_

Filters mails that tries to confuse the bayesian filter by integration random special chars into the words contained in the subject-line and mails with chinese and so on 'mystic-signs' in the subject.

Should be used as one of the first filters, because it is very quick and has a low rate on false-positives.
