### Scripts Filter v1.2.2

_by Bob Loeffler_

This filter blocks e-mails that contain embedded HTML scripts. Spammers can use these embedded scripts to do simple things such as open your web browser and take you directly to their website, but they may also cause more menacing issues, so it is better to stop them before they can do any damage!
