## The Spam Word Filter

Spamihilator uses a Word Filter to recognize spam mails. This filter scans new mails for common keywords: So called **Spam Words**.

The default installation of Spamihilator has many common spam words pre-defined. Of course, you can [add custom spam words]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configspamwords). Every keyword has a certain spam probability. If a word is most likely indicating a spam mail, its probability should have a value of 100%.

Spamihilator will block a mail if it contains keywords whose total spam probability exceeds the defined threshold. By default, the threshold level is set to 100%. You can adjust the behavior of the Word Filter by changing the [aggressiveness]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configaggressiveness) or changing the [spam probabilities]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configaggressiveness).

### Regular Expressions

Spamihilator's Word Filter has been improved a lot lately. Now it also supports regular expressions!

With regular expressions you can search not only for simple spam words but also for patterns that represent a spam word in a mail.
