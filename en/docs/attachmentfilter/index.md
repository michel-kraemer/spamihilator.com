## The Attachment Filter

The **Attachment Filter** is a Plugin. That means it is not directly integrated in Spamihilator, but it can be used to block Spam mails.

This filter blocks mails that contain suspicious attachments. It looks for executable files with the following extensions:

    .com, .scr, .pif, .bat, .exe, .vbs, .bas, .cmd,
    .cpl, .lnk, .reg, .vb, .vbe, .wsh

These files often contain viruses! So this filter is good protection against malware, but it doesn't replace your anti-virus software!

You can configure the attachments blocked by this filter by opening Spamihilator's [Settings dialog]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/config) and clicking on [Attachments]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configattachments).
