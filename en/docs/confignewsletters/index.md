## Newsletters

![Newsletter]({{ site.url }}/images/docs/en/confignewsletters_en.png)
{: .docs-screenshot }

These settings belong to the [Newsletter Plugin]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/newsletterplugin).

Configure the newsletters that you frequently receive. Newsletters will never be treated as spam.

#### Don't save newsletters in the Training Area

If this option is enabled, newsletters won't be listed in the Training Area anymore.

#### Automatically learn from newsletters

Enabling this option allows Spamihilator to learn from newsletters. You can enable this option only if "**Don't save newsletters in the Training Area**" is enabled.

Please note that newsletters often contain advertisements and, thus, the automatic learning may lead to incorrect filter results of the Learning Filter. So, enable this option only if you know what you're doing.
