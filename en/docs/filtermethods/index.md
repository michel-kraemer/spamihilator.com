## Filter Methods

Spamihilator uses two filtering methods to reach maximum spam protection. In step one, Spamihilator scans every new mail with the [Learning Filter]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/learningfilter). If this method is not able to categorize a mail as spam or non-spam, it will be processed by the [Word Filter]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/wordfilter).

You can disable one or both filters in Spamihilator's [settings dialog]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configfilter).

### Plugins

Furthermore, Spamihilator supports plugin filters - additional filters that can be included in the filtering process. The latest version already includes five plugins: The [Image Filter]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/imagefilter), the [Attachment Filter]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/attachmentfilter), the [DCC Filter]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/dccfilter), the [Link Filter]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/linkfilter) and the [Newsletter Plugin]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/newsletterplugin).

You can download more plugins from the [Spamihilator website]({{ site.url }}/en/plugins).
