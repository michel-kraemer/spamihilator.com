## Training Area

![Settings for the Training Area]({{ site.url }}/images/docs/en/configtrainingarea_en.png)
{: .docs-screenshot }

Use the [Training Area]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/trainingarea) to teach Spamihilator how to recognize spam mails. The most recently received mails will be saved and displayed in a list.

#### Don't keep messages more than [x] days

Limit the number of saved mails by specifying how many days they should stay in the Training Area.

#### Select next item from the list after marking a mail as Spam or Non-spam

The [Training Area]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/trainingarea) contains buttons to mark a mail as Spam or Non-spam respectively. If you press one of these buttons and this option is enabled, the next mail in the list will automatically be selected.

### Pre-mark

The "**Pre-mark**" options allow you to define whether Spamihilator shall mark only spam mails, or only non-spam mails, or both, in the Training Area.

If the option "**... automatically when Training Area is opened**" is enabled, pre-marking will be done automatically when the Training Area is displayed. You don't have to click on the "**Pre-Mark**" button anymore.
