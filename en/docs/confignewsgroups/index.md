## Newsgroups

![Newsgroup Settings]({{ site.url }}/images/docs/en/confignewsgroups_en.png)
{: .docs-screenshot }

These settings belong to the [Newsletter Plugin]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/newsletterplugin).

Many newsletter senders use the same receiver address for every mail they send (e.g. `newsletter@server.com`).

The same procedure is often used for newsgroups (e.g. [www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/)). If you are subscribed to a newsgroup, you receive every mail that is addressed to the newsgroup's mail address (e.g. `group@yahoo.com`).

Mails that are sent to these addresses will be directly forwarded to your mail client. They won't be blocked by Spamihilator. This procedure reduces _false positives_ (mails that have been blocked by mistake).

Click on the "**Add**" button to add a new newsgroup entry.

Never add your own mail address to this list! Otherwise, you will receive all mails without exception (including spam mails!).
{: .notewarning }

You can also remove existing newsgroups by clicking on an item in the list and then pressing the "**Delete**" button.
