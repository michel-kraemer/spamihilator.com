Spamihilator manages a list of your friends. Mails from these senders will never be deleted.

#### Add a sender

Click the "**New...**" button to add a new sender. A window will appear where you can enter the sender name and mail address of a friend. The mail address can contain wildcards (* and ?).

_Some examples:_

    user@server.com
    *@server.com
    coolfriend@*.com

Never add the wildcard address `*@*` to the list of Friends. Otherwise you will receive every mail (even Spam).

Never add your own e-mail address to the list of Friends. Many spammers fake their address and use yours.

#### Edit a sender

Select an entry from the list and choose "**Edit...**" to alter its settings.

#### Delete a sender

If you want to delete an entry from the list, click on it and choose "**Delete**".

### Import Address Book

If you have created an address book under Windows, you can add all of its contacts to the list of your friends. Simply click on "**Import...**".

When you click on "**Import...**", you can choose if you want to import your Windows Address Book or a text file. Text files, which need to be in comma-delimited format and have a `.csv` extension, can be generated by most mail clients.

Some mail clients support Drag&Drop. Just drag a mail from your mail client and drop it on the list to add its sender.
