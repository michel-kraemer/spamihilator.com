## The Rule Filter

The **Rule Filter** is a Plugin. That means it is not directly integrated in Spamihilator, but it can be used to block Spam mails.

The filter uses a configurable list of rules, that will be applied to incoming mails. Based on the result of the rule evaluation the filter moves the current mail to the [Recycle Bin]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/recycle) or renders it to the email client. If no rule can be applied the mail will be processed by the next filter in the [list]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configpriorities).

For a detailed description of possible rules have a look at [rules]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configrules).
