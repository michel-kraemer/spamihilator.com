## Senders

Spamihilator recognizes spam mails by using special filters (see [Filter Methods]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/filtermethods)). But you can also define senders that will always be deleted and some that will never be deleted.

These specific senders are called [Blocked Senders]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configblocked) and [Friends]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configfriends).
