## Signatures

![Signature Settings]({{ site.url }}/images/docs/en/configsignatures_en.png)
{: .docs-screenshot }

These settings belong to the [Newsletter Plugin]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/newsletterplugin).

The subject of most newsletters contains a specific signature (e.g. `[Spamihilator Newsletter]`).

Mails that have such a signature in the subject will be directly forwarded to your mail client. They won't be blocked by Spamihilator. This procedure reduces _false positives_ (mails that have been blocked by mistake).

Click on the "**Add**" button to add a new signature entry.

You can also remove existing signatures by clicking on an item in the list and then pressing the "**Delete**" button.
