## Attachments

![Attachment Filter Settings]({{ site.url }}/images/docs/en/configattachments_en.png)
{: .docs-screenshot }

These settings belong to the [Attachment Filter]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/attachmentfilter).

The Attachment Filter blocks mails that contain suspicious attachments. By default, it looks for executable files with the following extensions:

```
.com, .scr, .pif, .bat, .exe, .vbs, .bas, .cmd,
.cpl, .lnk, .reg, .vb, .vbe, .wsh
```

You can add new extensions by clicking on the "**Add**" button.

Of course, you can remove certain items from the list, too. Just click on them and press the "**Delete**" button.
