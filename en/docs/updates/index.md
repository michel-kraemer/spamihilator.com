## Check for Updates

You can check for new versions of Spamihilator on the Internet by selecting the "**Look for Updates...**" option. You must be online to do this.

The program compares your version with the one that is available on the Spamihilator server. If there is a newer version, you will be asked if you want to download the file.

If you click on "Yes", you will be redirected to the [Spamihilator download page]({{ site.url }}/en/download).

You can configure Spamihilator so that it looks for new updates automatically. Go to the [Settings dialog]({{ site.url }}/en/docs/configgeneral) to do that.
