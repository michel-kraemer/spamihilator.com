### Attachment Extensions Filter v0.9.6

_von Bob Loeffler_

This filter blocks e-mails that contain certain attachments, but it can also allow other e-mails to pass through to your e-mail application if they contain "good" attachments.  The filter is an extended version of the Attachments Filter that is installed by Spamihilator.
